## Overview
- My solution for the project four cards in Frontend Mentor

### The challenge
- Using media queries for the screen sizes as I am still new to it and it's concept

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
- I started with the desktop view first as it is easier for me.
- Split the title and cards into two sections the header and main section.
- Use flexbox for the title section(header) and grid for the cards.
- I then switch to tablet layout and then lastly the mobile layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (I don't know if it's semantic)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Deskto View First Workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned more about grid and a responsive design and a bit more of semantic HTML
